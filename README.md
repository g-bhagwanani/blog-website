# my-first-blog

This is a django project wherein I've created a website which can store and display my blogs.
To run, simply download the project and on the command line navigate to the project folder.
Then, type in the command- 'python manage.py runserver'
And you can now check out the website on your browser by going to http://127.0.0.1:800/
